                <title>My two cents on digital pathology</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there! As someone who has been working in the pathology AI field for some time, I have seen firsthand how important it is to create accurate and reliable models. These models have the potential to revolutionize patient care and medical research, but they can only reach their full potential if a few key components are in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three components that I have found to be essential are quality control (QC), generalizability, and proper validation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When developing an AI model, it’s critical to ensure that the data used is of high quality and that there are no issues with data collection or preprocessing. This step is crucial because poor data quality can lead to inaccurate and unreliable models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generalizability is also vital when creating AI models. It’s essential to ensure that the model can perform well on data that it has never seen before. By creating a generalizable model, we can ensure that the model will be useful in a wide range of applications and not just on the data set that was used to train it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, proper validation is crucial when developing AI models. The model should be tested on various data sets to ensure that it is not overfitting or underfitting the data. Proper validation ensures that the model is reliable, repeatable, and can be used in real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through my work in pathology AI, I have come to the conclusion that these components are essential to the success of any AI model. They may seem like challenges to overcome, but with the right planning, these components can be addressed, leading to reliable and robust models. I will explain these in further details in the next blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to emphasize that AI models will be doomed to fail if quality control, generalizability, and validation are not considered. If you ever want to make sure that your models are deployable, they have to meet this criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in learning more about creating robust AI solutions for whole slide images, Keep reading my blog and reach out to me for any help!&lt;/p&gt;
