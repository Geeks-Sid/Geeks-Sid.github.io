# System Design Summarized

**How to answer anything in System Design?**

Always go first principles and build ground up.

1. **Seek clarification**: Ask for additional details and clarifications.
2. **Gather requirements**: Understand system features, constraints, and common problems.
3. **Plan and prioritize**: Evaluate requirements and prioritize them.
4. **Propose a high-level design**: Outline components and their interactions in the system.
5. **Discuss pros and cons**: Analyze advantages and disadvantages of the design.
6. **Evaluate trade-offs**: Consider trade-offs in design decisions.
7. **Iterate and refine**: Be open to feedback and revise the design if needed.

The approach focuses on analyzing requirements, proposing solutions, evaluating trade-offs, and demonstrating critical thinking and effective communication skills.

**Scalability**

- Scalability in system design refers to a system's ability to handle increased work or traffic without performance compromise.
- Two types of scalability: vertical (scaling up individual components) and horizontal (scaling out by adding more instances).
- To ensure scalability, employ the following design principles and practices:
    1. **Loose coupling**: Minimize dependencies and define clear interfaces for independent scaling.
    2. **Load balancing:** Distribute workload evenly to prevent bottlenecks.
    3. **Caching:** Use caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce backend load.
    4. **Distributed architecture:** Design systems as loosely-coupled services for easier horizontal scaling.
    5. **Database scaling strategies:** Choose appropriate techniques like sharding or replication to handle increased traffic.
    6. **Monitoring and performance testing:** Regularly monitor and test system performance to identify and address scalability issues proactively.

**Designing Distributed Systems (DDS)**

When designing a distributed system for fault tolerance and high availability, the following factors should be considered:

1. **Redundancy:** Introduce redundancy at various levels to mitigate the impact of failures.
2. **Replication:** Replicate data and services across multiple nodes in the system.
3. **Failover mechanisms:** Implement mechanisms to automatically switch to backup resources or nodes.
4. **Load balancing:** Distribute the workload evenly across multiple nodes to prevent overloading.
5. **Health monitoring and fault detection:** Continuously monitor system components for failures or degraded performance.
6. **Graceful degradation:** Design the system to operate in a reduced capacity when components or features become unavailable.
7. **Error handling and retries:** Implement robust mechanisms to handle network failures and retries.
8. **Distributed data consistency**: Address challenges in maintaining data consistency across multiple nodes.
9. **Disaster recovery and backup:** Plan for backup and restore processes in case of catastrophic failures.
10. **Isolation and fault containment**: Design components with proper isolation to contain failures.

Considering these factors helps ensure fault tolerance and high availability in distributed systems.

**Designing Caching Systems (DCS)**

Designing a caching system for a web application involves the following steps and considerations:

1. **Identify caching requirements:** Determine which parts of the application would benefit from caching.
2. **Determine cache granularity:** Decide at what level to cache data (e.g., page, fragment, query).
3. **Select caching strategies:** Choose appropriate strategies like full-page caching, fragment caching, or data caching.
4. **Determine cache eviction policy:** Decide how long cached items should be stored before being evicted or invalidated.
5. **Handle cache invalidation:** Establish mechanisms to update or invalidate cached items when underlying data changes.
6. **Consider cache storage:** Choose the right storage technology based on latency, scalability, and fault tolerance requirements.
7. **Measure and optimize:** Continuously monitor and optimize the caching system based on cache hit rates, response times, and resource utilization.

Trade-offs to consider include cache consistency, cache expiration vs. data freshness, cache storage limitations, cache warm-up, and cache maintenance overhead.

By carefully considering these factors and trade-offs, an effective caching system can be designed to improve performance and scalability. Regular monitoring and optimization are important for adapting to changing usage patterns and data updates.

**Caching Strategies**

1. **Caching**: Technique to improve performance by storing frequently accessed data in a fast and temporary storage layer.
2. **Write-through Strategy**: Simultaneously writes new or updated data to both cache and data source for consistency.
3. **Write-around Strategy**: Bypasses the cache and writes new or updated data directly to the data source to reduce cache write load.
4. **Write-back Strategy**: Writes new or updated data only to the cache initially, with eventual write-back to the data source.
5. **Refresh Strategy**: Sets expiration time for cached data, triggering a refresh from the data source after expiration.
6. **Cache Invalidation Strategy**: Explicitly invalidates or clears the cache when relevant data is updated in the data source.

Choice of cache update strategy depends on system requirements, including data consistency, read/write performance, and data update frequency. Different strategies can be combined for optimized performance and data consistency.

**Designing Distributed DataBase Schema (DDBS)**

When designing a database schema for a new application, follow these steps and consider the following factors:

1. Understand application requirements: Thoroughly understand the purpose and data needs of the application.
2. Identify data entities and relationships: Determine the entities and their relationships.
3. Normalize the data: Apply normalization techniques to ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy.
4. Denormalization (if necessary): Evaluate the need for denormalization for performance optimization.
5. Define primary keys and constraints: Establish primary keys and enforce data integrity constraints.
6. Determine data types and sizes: Choose appropriate data types and sizes based on data characteristics.
7. Indexing strategy: Plan indexing based on anticipated query patterns and performance requirements.
8. Handle data consistency and integrity: Establish mechanisms to ensure data consistency and integrity.
9. Consider performance and scalability: Design with scalability and performance in mind.
10. Security and access control: Implement security measures to protect sensitive data.
11. Future extensibility and flexibility: Design for future changes and enhancements.
12. Test and iterate: Validate the design through testing and performance analysis.

Collaboration, regular reviews, and monitoring are important throughout the process. Adjustments may be needed as the application evolves.
