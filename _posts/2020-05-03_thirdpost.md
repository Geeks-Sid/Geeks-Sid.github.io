# H&E Lung molecular prediction thoughts

As someone with a keen interest in the world of machine learning and predictive modeling, I was particularly intrigued by a study conducted by Gabriele Campanella and colleagues. This research, titled "H&E-based Computational Biomarker Enables Universal EGFR Screening for Lung Adenocarcinoma," delved into the fascinating arena of predicting molecular biomarkers from H&E.

The research team developed several models to predict EGFR mutation status for lung adenocarcinoma, a critical component in the prognosis and treatment of this disease. The initial stages of this model development involved a semantic segmentation model that identified 13 different tissue subtypes. They trained their EGFR model using only tumor tiles, a strategic move that allowed them to focus on the areas most likely to harbor the mutations of interest. This was not the extent of their experimental exploration, as they also dabbled in the creation of tissue-type specific models.

One aspect of this research that I found particularly noteworthy was the comparative approach taken by the team. They juxtaposed a fully supervised model that applied patient-level labels to all tiles, a fully supervised model confined to tumor tiles, a gated attention model, and a transformer multiple instance model incorporating the relative position of tiles. These diverse methods provided a comprehensive overview of the varying effectiveness of different model types.

The training of these models was conducted on an in-house dataset, which was later validated on a set of external cases as well as on the well-known TCGA. Such a multi-faceted approach to validation helped in assessing the model's generalizability and robustness under different circumstances.

The insights gained from this research were numerous and intriguing, to say the least. The gated attention model emerged as the top performer, which was quite revealing. It suggested that the higher level spatial morphology is not as vital for EGFR prediction as one might intuitively presume. The performance of the model on the external validation set mirrored that on the held-out portion of their in-house dataset, indicating impressive generalization capabilities.

Moreover, the model demonstrated admirable resilience when it came to samples with low tissue or tumor presence or cases where DNA yield was too low for conventional molecular testing. However, when it came to TCGA, the model's performance was subpar, necessitating the exclusion of about half the slides containing artifacts to attain satisfactory results. This served as a stark reminder of the pitfalls and challenges in using public datasets like the TCGA.

Interestingly, the model's performance wasn't uniform across all subgroups. It varied across primary versus metastatic cases, smoking versus non-smoking individuals, solid subtype, and TP53 status. These variations hint at the underlying complexities and intricacies of the disease process and the influence of various external and internal factors on the EGFR mutation status.

One of the key strategies employed by the team was the use of attention scores and segmentation results, which facilitated the identification of tissue types associated with EGFR mutation and wildtype. The tissue-type specific models performed variably with different tissue types. It turned out that some subtypes led to better models than others, signifying that certain subtypes possess fewer discriminative morphologic traits.

The research team didn't shy away from experimenting with the addition of different variables to the model. Adding smoking status proved to be beneficial, but the inclusion of other variables and PET images failed to improve the results. This process of trial and error was instrumental in identifying which factors significantly influence the model's performance.

The study also made a significant contribution to the field of pathology. The attention scores, combined with the discrimination layer, aided pathologists in identifying morphological associations for each class. Furthermore, pathologists could pinpoint common characteristics of false positive and false negative tiles, which could potentially guide strategies for enhancing model results in the future.

An intriguing revelation from this research was the estimation of rates of sub-optimal treatment in various countries. This was due to the lack of molecular testing and targeted therapy, providing a stark reality check on the global healthcare disparity. These estimates underscored the potential clinical value of EGFR prediction from H&E, which could be a game-changer in regions where access to advanced molecular testing is limited or non-existent.

One of the salient criticisms put forth by the authors was regarding the use of TCGA for training datasets. They contended that the challenges they encountered while training with TCGA warranted a case for training with non-TCGA datasets. This criticism of TCGA was quite profound, as it is one of the largest and most widely used public datasets, revered for its vastness and diversity. The authors highlighted the fact that even such extensive datasets might be riddled with issues that could potentially compromise the quality of machine learning models.

This paper, with its extensive exploration into the prediction of EGFR mutation status, was an enlightening read. It unraveled several potential pitfalls, or "gotchas," for training biomarker models or any model type on TCGA. These insights offer a cautionary tale for researchers relying solely on such public databases and underscore the importance of rigorous quality control and validation measures when dealing with these datasets.

The paper also emphasized the need for adaptability in model development. They illustrated this through their use of different model types, the inclusion and exclusion of various variables, and their comprehensive validation strategies. This emphasis on adaptability is a crucial takeaway for anyone in the field of machine learning or predictive modeling, as it underscores the fact that there is no one-size-fits-all model. It necessitates a thorough understanding of the underlying data, disease processes, and the specific requirements of the task at hand.

The paper left me pondering several things, not least of which was the question of their criticism of TCGA. Is TCGA, with its vast and diverse data, not the gold standard we perceive it to be? Are the challenges faced by this research team in using TCGA a common occurrence, or were they unique to this particular task of predicting EGFR mutation status? These questions have led me to question the criticisms levied against TCGA. Do you agree with these criticisms?

In summary, the research by Gabriele Campanella and team opened up a new perspective on the use of computational models for predicting EGFR mutation status in lung adenocarcinoma. It underscored the importance of data quality, the need for comprehensive validation, and the role of diverse variables in influencing model performance. The insights gleaned from this research will undoubtedly serve as valuable guides for future endeavors in this field.
